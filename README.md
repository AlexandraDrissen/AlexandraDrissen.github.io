### About Me
Hi I'm Alexandra and I am a digital marketeer turned data analyst. I have a strong business and marketing principles foundation but developed a passion for data. By self-study, freelancing, and pursuing a traineeship in Power BI, I aim to learn more about something I am passionate about: data. 

During my graduate internship, I had the possibility to work with different types of data regarding market intelligence and I developed sufficient skills to gather all needed data into an easy-to-use dashboard for the team. While this opportunity started my love for data, I have now gotten the chance to learn further in a traineeship along with much self-study. I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

_With my strong background in international business and digital marketing, I can turn your data into profit_

## Demographics HR dashboard | Excel and Power BI
Tools: Excel, Power BI, DAX, visualizations

Goals: The employee dashboard aims to identify the current demographics of the current staff for future recruiting purposes and to check whether, over time, goals of inclusivity and diversity are achieved. The company aims to have 50% females in leadership roles and increase its youngest generation of employees to 8% of the total staff. They also aim to have a balance in terms of race and keep track of bonuses to ensure that longer-term employees get rewarded for their retention and that there is no discrimination in giving out bonuses.

End result:

Key conclusions: When keeping in mind the set goals for the company, the diversity and inclusion goals are met in terms of ethnicity balance in the company but still needs improvement for females in leadership positions and the amount for Gen Z employees across the company.
